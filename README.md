# CalorieX
A fitness and nutrition tracker that aims to make the experience more engaging and motivating by incorporating gamification features
such as tracking an individual's progress. Users will be able to create an account and login to the app to track their progress, log their food and exercise, 
set and track goals, and view their progress and goals in an easy-to-understand format.

One of the notable features of the app is the use of machine learning to enable image-based calorie estimation. This feature will allow users to take 
a picture of their food and receive an estimated calorie count, making the tracking process easier and more efficient. Additionally, the app will 
use machine learning for real-time food detection and tracking, and for generating accurate nutritional information such as calorie and macronutrient content. 
The app's integration of machine learning technology sets it apart from other fitness and nutrition tracking apps, making it a unique and innovative solution 
for users looking to improve their health and wellness.
